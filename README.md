# JS Drum Kit

# Description
For the new year I'm sharpening up my JS skills with javascript30.com.  It's an awesome, free program that helps you kick up your vanilla JS skills notch.
This first project was a tutorial on how to create your own drum kit with pure JS.  check out the deployed page to do some drumming!
